#How do I approach designing software?

  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  Some new design skills this project has helped me craft were evaluating a large project and breaking it down into smaller pieces, identifying familiar elements and assessing what knowledge I have that is applicable to the demands of the familiar elements, and identifying unfamiliar elements along with researching to find the best approach for development.
  
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
    The process I followed was first gathering reference material, then I wrote out how I thought the reference material would translate to basic 3D shapes, then I worked in stages of creating each object from the basic shapes, added texutre, controls, and then lighting for each individual object. After I have the individual objects figured out, I combined them into one project.
  
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    In my future work, I will be able to apply the gathering of relavant information for the requirments of the project, drafting out the general functions of the project in plain words, and divinding the project into chunks in almost any project. It may look a little bit different, but he idea of how I planned out this project can be translated to most other projects.
  
#How do I approach developing programs?

  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    One strategy I relied on heavily was I tried to create small chunks of working code at a time. This made it easier to undertand where I made mistakes and why they happened. It also made the process quicker. Also, while writing the code, I thought of how my different functions could be used else where and how best to write each function to be reusable.
    
  How did iteration factor into your development?
    While working on this project, I learned a lot about what not to do when creating multiple iterations of a project. What I wish I did was truly look ahead to fully understand the direction the project was going in to better set up previous iterations of the project to better translate to later iterations. While much of the code I wrote was perfectly fine for the simpler milestones, I found that as the milestones added more and more elements, the code I had written in previous iterations no longer was efficient. This led to a project that should have been split into multiple files (which would have increased the recyclability and decreased the redundancies of the code) existing in one source file that was very difficult to navigate through and would not have been easy to adapt to a more efficient format.
    
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    Initally, I had put a lot of thought into trying to write efficient code. However, I realized in the last couple milestones I had made a big mistake by having everyting exist in one source file. I then tried to pivot my approach but that lead to missing a deadline. For the final project deadline, I focused on cranking out working code that met the requirments regardless of if the code itself was pretty.
  
#How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future           educational pathway?
  Computational graphics and visualization showed me that I both know much more than I thought and also hardly anything at all about writing code. Also, it made me realize that all of the skills I needed for my classes, I either already had from previous classes or were available to me in the required materials. This may seem like a silly lesson to learn this late in the game, however I had gotten so use to figuring things out quickly even when things were new that when I was confronted with some of the biggest challenges I have ever faced, I found myself stumped and wondering how I got this point and how I was expected to complete the tasks asked of me. All it really took was taking a second to identify exactly what parts I understood and what I didn't and then I worked my way through the reading material and checked the knowledge I had and connected it to the new knowledge to fill in the gaps. This skill is something that I will need for every other class I'm going to take and really any other time I learn something new that isn't intuitive to me.
    
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future   professional pathway?
  I ended up far from my comfort zone and because of that, I learned to find things that I do recognize and how to approach the things that I don't. I also learned the importance of properly designing and planning your approach to a project and I will forever carry that lesson with me throughtout education and my career. Because I focused on the completing the individual milestones initally rather than thinking of how the milestones fit into the larger project, I coded myself into so many corners and ended up settling for getting ugly working code out.
